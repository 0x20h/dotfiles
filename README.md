# dotfiles

## dotfiles/

All files/directories (`$f`) in the dotfiles folder will be copied to
`~/.$f`

## pins file

the pins file contains entries with 2 columns, separated by a ` `
whitespace character. The first columns refers to the file in `install.d`
the second to a git tag or branch. You can use it to pin the installed software
to a fixed version. You can request the pin with the `pins $name` function,
e.g.

```sh
git checkout $(pin node)
```

## install.d/*

create a shell script in install.d with 2 functions:

- depends(): echo debian packages to be installed (e.g. `echo "git curl"`)
- install(): install the software, do whatever is needed
